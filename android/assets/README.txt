This is a small game coded in around 12 hours for a friend who wanted to showcase some graphics he
made via a videogame.

This game has some basic functionalities. You can move using the arrow keys, grab armor from the
chest when you walk up to it by pressing spacebar (though you have to time walking up to it and
pressing spacebar to make it work), and travel to a few areas. That's pretty much it.

This program was created using LibGDX on the android platform, in case I ever feel like creating
controls for mobile use.
